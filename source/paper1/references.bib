 abstract = {In this paper, we explore graduates' characterisations of their learning experiences at university and beyond. Using a narrative methodology, we elicited life stories from graduates of the School of Computing at the University of Kent. We initially review and situate our approach within the wide variety of existing narrative approaches. Then, we turn to an aspect of the student experience that struck us as particularly significant: the 'year in industry'. We discuss the accounts of ten participants who completed a year in industry and highlight their perspectives of the effect it had on them. Finally, we propose a narrative construction of the concept of graduateness -- of what it means to complete a university degree.},

@inproceedings{dziallasLearningContextFirst2021a,
 abstract = {In this paper, we examine a new Graduate Apprenticeship program. Graduate Apprenticeships (and degree-level apprenticeships more broadly) were established in the United Kingdom with the expressed goal of addressing the persistent skills gap, with employers facing difficulties in recruiting adequately skilled employees, and at the same time promoting opportunities for students who would not have otherwise pursued a computing degree. We take a 360-degree view of this novel program and explore why the university chose to pursue it, why the employers decided to participate in it, and how the students are experiencing it. To do so, we draw on three kinds of data: life story interviews with students in the first cohort of the Graduate Apprenticeship that focus on the individual learning journeys that brought them to the program; a consultation and series of individual interviews with employers to examine their aims for participating in the program; a diary study with all apprentices over a period of four weeks to explore the kinds of work they were doing on a day-to-day basis in their companies. In our ``first look'' at this program, we highlight aspects that make it particularly attractive to this student body and explore the actual work apprentices are doing in their companies after a year in the program. As well as providing local insight, we more broadly present this program in its context as an example of an evolutionary response to forces on an educational system.},

@article{holmegaardWhereEngineeringApplied2016,
 abstract = {This paper presents results from a qualitative longitudinal study of students' transition into higher education engineering. The study aims at comparing upper-secondary school students' expectations of engineering with their actual experiences when encountering the engineering programme. It explores how this encounter provides a platform for students to become integrated during first year. We find that students' expectations are poorly met by their first-year study programme. In their attempt to bridge the gap between their expectations and their experiences, the students apply three strategies: some endure the gap, some constantly try out different study strategies and some compromised their expectations and identities to become more aligned with the study programme. The findings show that even when students successfully manage to bridge the gap, their strategy may turn out to be counterproductive from a learning point of view. The implications of the study are discussed.},

PNI methods help people discover insights, catch emerging trends, make decisions, generate ideas, resolve conflicts, and connect people.Participatory narrative inquiry draws on theory and practice in narrative inquiry, participatory action research, oral history, mixed-methods research, participatory theatre, narrative therapy, sensemaking, complexity theory, and decision support. Its focus is on the exploration of values, beliefs, feelings, and perspectives through collaborative sensemaking with stories of lived experience.ContentsIntroductionFundamentals of Story WorkWhat Is a Story?What Are Stories For?How Do Stories Work?Stories in Communities and OrganizationsA Guide to Participatory Narrative InquiryIntroducing Participatory Narrative InquiryProject PlanningStory CollectionGroup Exercises for Story CollectionNarrative CatalysisNarrative SensemakingGroup Exercises for Narrative SensemakingNarrative InterventionNarrative ReturnAppendicesExample Models and Templates for Group ExercisesFurther Reading: Your PNI BookshelfBibliographyAcknowledgements and BiographyGlossaryIndexReader praise"I wanted to say thanks for making Working with Stories available.

@book{laveSituatedLearningLegitimate1991,
 abstract = {In this important theoretical treatise, Jean Lave, anthropologist, and Etienne Wenger,  computer scientist, push forward the notion of situated learning--that learning is fundamentally a social process and not solely in the learner's head. The authors maintain that learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral participation. Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community. Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities, identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice.  The communities discussed in the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

@book{mattinglyHealingDramasClinical1998,
 abstract = {There is growing interest in "therapeutic narratives" and the relation between narrative and healing. Cheryl Mattingly's ethnography of the practice of occupational therapy in a North American hospital investigates the complex interconnections between narrative and experience in clinical work. Viewing the world of disability as a socially constructed experience, it presents fascinatingly detailed case studies of clinical interactions between occupational therapists and patients, many of them severely injured and disabled, and illustrates the diverse ways in which an ordinary clinical interchange is transformed into a dramatic experience governed by a narrative plot. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including anthropological studies of narrative and ritual, literary theory, phenomenology and hermeneutics, this book develops a narrative theory of social action and experience. While most contemporary theories of narrative presume that narratives impose an artificial coherence upon lived experience, Mattingly argues for a revision of the classic mimetic position. If narrative offers a correspondence to lived experience, she contends, the dominant formal feature which connects the two is not narrative coherence but narrative drama. Moving and sophisticated, this book is an innovative contribution to the study of modern institutions and to anthropological theory.},

@article{mcadamsWhatWeKnow1995,
 abstract = {ABSTRACT Individual differences in personality may be described at three different levels. Level I consists of those broad, de contextualized, and relatively non conditional constructs called ``traits,'' which provide a dispositional signature for personality description. No description of a person is adequate without trait attributions, but trait attributions themselves yield little beyond a ``psychology of the stranger.'' At Level II (called ``personal concerns''), personality descriptions invoke personal strivings, life tasks, defense mechanisms, coping strategies, domain-specific skills and values, and a wide assortment of other motivational, developmental, or strategic constructs that are contextualized in time, place, or role. While dispositional traits and personal concerns appear to have near-universal applicability. Level III presents frameworks and constructs that may be uniquely relevant to adulthood only, and perhaps only within modern societies that put a premium on the individuation of the self. Thus, in contemporary Western societies, a full description of personality commonly requires a consideration of the extent to which a human life expresses unity and purpose, which are the hallmarks of identity. Identity in adulthood is an inner story of the self that integrates the reconstructed past, perceived present, and anticipated future to provide a life with unity, purpose, and meaning. At Level III, psychologists may explore the person's identity as an internalized and evolving life story. Each of the three levels has its own geography and requires its own indigenous nomenclatures, taxonomies, theories, frameworks, and laws.},
