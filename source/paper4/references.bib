	abstract = {Current engineering curriculums have evolved over the past several years to address multiple concerns raised by industry. Their concerns include interdisciplinary engineering teams, teambuilding, project management, and others directly related to successful engineering careers. In order to better prepare future engineers, universities have implemented a variety of capstone courses to address industry concerns, as well as ABET EC2000 criteria. Capstone courses range in content from teams of students in the same discipline, working on the same or different projects, to industry-sponsored design projects primarily focused on producing paper designs. In very few instances schools require student teams to physically produce their designs. This paper discusses implementation and coordination of the projects, benefits of using industry-academic partnerships for capstone design courses, how the course effectively meets and exceeds industry and ABET concerns, additional benefits for the engineering school and the community. In addition, examples of several projects are presented.},

	abstract = {A significant body of research identifies a large number of team composition characteristics that affect the success of individuals and teams in cooperative learning and project-based team environments. Controlling these factors when assigning students to teams should result in improved learning experiences. However, it is very difficult for instructors to consider more than a few criteria when assigning teams, particularly in large classes. As a result, most instructors allow students to self-select teams, randomly assign teams, or, at best, balance teams on a very limited number of criteria.},

	title = {Team formation in the {ECE} {Capstone} course and studying impact},
	abstract = {This paper describes an instructor-assigned team formation technique used for an electrical and computer engineering (ECE) capstone design class which is devised to take technical and nontechnical skills, individualized personality profiles, student team preferences, and other intangible details about each student into consideration for team assignment. The paper explains each of these parameters in detail and their impact on the team formation process. Three main goals achieved by this team formation process are optimizing team assignments across the entire class, teaching students’ team effectiveness, and making it easier to assign teams across large class sizes (140 students, 35 projects). The method results in a marked improvement in the team's final assessments, project success and feedback collected over the dataset. The purpose of this paper is to share the technique and nuances that has made this instructor-assigned team assignment successful and feasible for large classes. Finally, this paper shares methods to add depth to the teamwork learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {This research paper answers the question that how shall the students of software engineering undergraduate courses form teams for the capstone projects that can be cohesive too. In this research, 128 criteria for team formation are proposed for building teams for self-managing software engineering capstone projects. A comparison is also conducted to ascertain the level of cohesion among those teams that were formed using the proposed criteria and those that were not formed using the proposed criteria. The criteria were identiﬁed through a combination of qualitative questionnaire survey targeted at the graduated students of the past batches of Computer Science degree program and through synthesizing the literature on engineering capstone project teams identiﬁed under the guidance of KSAO framework for software engineering students. To check the effectiveness of the criteria, 100 students were asked to form the teams using the proposed criteria and other 100 students formed the teams without the proposed criteria. Those students that had used the proposed criteria for building teams and those that had formed teams without using the proposed criteria were asked to ﬁll the modiﬁed Group Environment Questionnaire to ascertain the level of cohesion among the team members. The results were analyzed qualitatively and through descriptive quantiﬁcation. The results show that the level of cohesion in teams that were formed using the proposed team building criteria was higher. There was a need for team building criteria in the literature on software engineering capstone project teams that conforms to a conceptual, theoretical framework; this gap is now ﬁlled through this research. This paper may also serve as a literature review paper for some readers.},
