% background
Optimal group formation and project matching are critical and challenging tasks for instructors.
% methods
We developed the Student-Project Matching Tool to optimize these processes and piloted it in a Computer Science Capstone course at the University of California, Irvine. The tool ensures that the team formation process balances individual preferences, project compatibility, and the overall performance potential of each team by considering students' skills and interests and sponsor projects' needs to maximize teams' success.
% results
Student perspectives and feedback showed an increase in student satisfaction with their team and the project they were matched to. Similarly, positive sponsor evaluations of the teams demonstrated that sponsors were pleased with the teams they were matched to.
% conclusion
This tool provides the basis for effective team formation and project matching in Capstone courses, with a focus on maximizing student learning outcomes, real-world experiences, student-project ownership, and the number of fulfilled skills that each project requires for completion.
