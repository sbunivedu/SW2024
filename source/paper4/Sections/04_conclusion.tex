\section{Conclusion and Future Work}


In conclusion, the SPMT pilot in a Computer Science Capstone course has demonstrated positive outcomes, enhancing student satisfaction with skillset growth, team formation, and project assignments. Acknowledging the initial limitations in the availability of industry-sponsored projects during the pilot, our future work focuses on diversifying opportunities and expanding the pool of available projects. We plan to optimize the SPMT by testing various matching algorithms to maximize student learning when limited projects are available. Additionally, new, more targeted feedback surveys will be designed to gather deeper insights for ongoing refinement of the SPMT. 
The SPMT shows promise as a tool for enhancing team formation and project matching in SWE, and ongoing efforts should continue to focus on improving student learning outcomes and real-world experiences.
